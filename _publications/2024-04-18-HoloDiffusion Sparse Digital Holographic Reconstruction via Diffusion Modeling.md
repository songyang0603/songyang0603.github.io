## Abstract
In digital holography, reconstructed image quality can be primarily limited due to the inability of a single small aperture sensor to cover the entire field of a hologram. The use of multi-sensor arrays in synthetic aperture digital holographic imaging technology contributes to overcoming the limitations of sensor coverage by expanding the area for detection. However, imaging accuracy is affected by the gap size between sensors and the resolution of sensors, especially when dealing with a limited number of sensors. An image reconstruction method is proposed that combines physical constraint characteristics of the imaging object with a score-based diffusion model, aiming to enhance the imaging accuracy of digital holography technology with extremely sparse sensor arrays. Prior information of the sample is learned by the neural network in the diffusion model to obtain a score function, which alternately constrains the iterative reconstruction process with the underlying physical model. The results demonstrate that the structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed images using this method are higher than the traditional method, along with a strong generalization ability.
